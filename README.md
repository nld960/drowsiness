# Drowsiness Detection  

System for drowsiness detection in vehicles.

## Background  

According to the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, 20% of fatal collisions are caused by drowsy drivers. This project is made to warn the driver about drowsiness and inattentiveness. It uses certain facial landmarks (ex: the top and bottom of the mouth), measures the distance between them, and thereby determines certain facial expressions such as yawning.  

For me, this all began on a camping trip with my family... but that's a story for a different time. Rest assured there was no collision involved.  

## Environment

This was developed in Google Colab. Some parts of the program, such as loading the Dlib shape predictor (`shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat`), may need to be modified to fit your requirements.  

Also, this is a demo script. I have not included the Raspberry Pi version.
